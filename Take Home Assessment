To address the challenges presented in the AdvertiseX case study, we can break down the solution into four main components: Data Ingestion, Data Processing, Data Storage and Query Performance, and Error Handling and Monitoring. Here’s a detailed design and implementation plan for each component:

1. Data Ingestion
Requirements:
Handle ad impressions in JSON format.
Handle clicks and conversions in CSV format.
Handle bid requests in Avro format.
Support both real-time and batch processing.
Design and Implementation:
Technologies:

Apache Kafka for real-time data streaming.
Apache Flume or AWS Kinesis for batch data ingestion.
Apache NiFi for flexible and reliable data flow management.
Steps:

Kafka Setup:

Create Kafka topics for each data source: ad_impressions, clicks_conversions, and bid_requests.
Use Kafka producers to push data into these topics.
NiFi Workflow:

Create NiFi processors to consume data from Kafka topics.
Use appropriate processors to parse JSON, CSV, and Avro formats.
Route data to different flows based on its source for further processing.
Batch Ingestion with Flume/Kinesis:

Configure Flume agents to collect and transport batch data to a staging area in HDFS or S3.
Use Kinesis Firehose for batch ingestion into data lakes like Amazon S3.
2. Data Processing
Requirements:
Standardize and enrich data.
Validate, filter, and deduplicate data.
Correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions.
Design and Implementation:
Technologies:

Apache Spark for data processing and transformation.
Apache Airflow for orchestration of ETL pipelines.
Steps:

Data Transformation with Spark:

Read data from Kafka topics using Spark Streaming.
Parse and standardize data from JSON, CSV, and Avro formats.
Enrich data by joining with reference data (e.g., ad campaign details).
Data Validation and Deduplication:

Implement validation rules to filter out invalid data.
Use Spark’s window functions to identify and remove duplicate records.
Data Correlation:

Implement logic to correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions based on user IDs and timestamps.
Create intermediate datasets to store correlated data for further analysis.
Orchestration with Airflow:

Schedule and monitor ETL jobs using Apache Airflow.
Define DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) to manage dependencies between tasks.
3. Data Storage and Query Performance
Requirements:
Efficient storage of processed data.
Fast querying for campaign performance analysis.
Optimization for analytical queries and aggregations.
Design and Implementation:
Technologies:

Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for data warehousing.
Apache Hive or Delta Lake on Databricks for data lake storage.
Presto or Amazon Athena for interactive querying.
Steps:

Data Warehousing:

Load processed data into Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery for fast analytical queries.
Use partitioning and clustering to optimize query performance.
Data Lake Storage:

Store raw and processed data in Apache Hive or Delta Lake.
Use optimized file formats like Parquet or ORC for efficient storage and querying.
Query Optimization:

Create materialized views or summary tables for frequently accessed aggregations.
Use query optimization techniques like indexing and caching to improve performance.
4. Error Handling and Monitoring
Requirements:
Detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays.
Real-time alerting for data quality issues.
Design and Implementation:
Technologies:

Apache Kafka for real-time data stream monitoring.
Prometheus and Grafana for metrics collection and visualization.
ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log analysis.
Steps:

Real-Time Monitoring:

Implement Kafka consumers to monitor data streams for anomalies.
Use Prometheus to collect metrics on data ingestion and processing.
Alerting Mechanisms:

Set up alert rules in Prometheus to trigger notifications for data quality issues.
Use Grafana to visualize metrics and provide real-time dashboards for monitoring.
Log Analysis:

Use Logstash to collect and parse logs from various components.
Store logs in Elasticsearch and create Kibana dashboards for log analysis.
Conclusion
This solution provides a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges faced by AdvertiseX in handling large volumes of data from various sources in different formats. By leveraging modern data engineering technologies and best practices, we can build a scalable, efficient, and reliable data pipeline that meets the company’s needs for data ingestion, processing, storage, and monitoring.
